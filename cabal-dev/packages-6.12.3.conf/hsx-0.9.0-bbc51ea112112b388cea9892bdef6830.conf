description: HSX (Haskell Source with XML) allows literal XML syntax to be used in Haskell source code.
             The trhsx preprocessor translates .hsx source files into ordinary .hs files. Literal
             XML syntax is translated into function calls for creating XML values of the appropriate
             forms.
             trhsx transforms literal XML syntax into a series of function calls. Any project
             can make use of the syntax by providing definitions for those functions, and the
             XML values produced will be of the types specified. This works for any types, since
             trhsx doesn't make any assumptions, or inserts any information depending on types.
             XMLGenerator defines a few typeclasses that together cover the functions injected by the
             preprocessor. A project that uses these classes to provide the semantics for the injected
             syntax will be able to use any functions written in terms of these, allowing better code
             reusability than if each project defines its own semantics for the XML syntax. Also, the classes
             makes it possible to use the literal syntax at different types within the same module.
             Achieving that is not as simple as it may seem, but the XMLGenerator module provides all the
             necessary machinery.
