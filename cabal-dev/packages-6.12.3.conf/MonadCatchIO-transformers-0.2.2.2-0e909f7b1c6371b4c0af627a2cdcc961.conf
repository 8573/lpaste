description: Provides functions to throw and catch exceptions. Unlike the functions from
             @Control.Exception@, which work in @IO@, these work in any stack of monad
             transformers (from the 'transformers' package) with @IO@ as the base monad.
             You can extend this functionality to other monads, by creating an instance
             of the @MonadCatchIO@ class.
